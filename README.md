# Alien-Invasion developed in python
My first game. Created to practice python. 
You need following Packages to run the game.
1:- pip install PyGame

Edit settings.py as you need.
I have added comments under all the functions about what they do.
Best way to learn programming language is make game on it so it's get interesting.
